1. Class and Objects (examples)

2. Class has data/attributes and functions/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    attributes get called itself, methods are called manually

3. Why is Python called OOPS
    >everything in python is an object

4. Advantages of OOPS
    >you can create your own datatype
    >code reusability
    >debugging
    >easy to collab

5. End to End project
    >function vs methods
    >magic method / dunder method
    >self
    >you can attribute outside of class as well
    >encapsulation
    >getter and setter
    >static methods

6. Inheritance
    >Why do we need it - code reusability, non private attributes/methods
    >constructor/method overloading
    >super keyword

    >Inheritance types
        >Single - inherits parent attributes/methods
        >Multiple - inherits multiple parents
        >Hierarchial - multiple children inherit single parent
        >diamond - uses super() to inherit methods
